# [Birth Spiral](https://kanoding.github.io/birthspiral/)
Find the spiral of your Birthday!

*Made with p5.js &amp; TurtleGraphics*
Try it [here!](https://kanoding.github.io/birthspiral/)

## To Do's
- find appropriate LICENSE
- create a fun homepage
- parse the numerical input and use it as a variable for the spiral color, length, ... (angle should be at least 35)
- create a "best of" of the parameters: angle 225 is really cool! With angles after 90Â° the spiral twists! Try 3456
- adding a slider for changing the color of the background: B/W or RGB?
- add the possibility to press the key "enter" for starting a new spiral
- possibility to save the canvas as an image, pdf or GIF
- possibility to send the image via email
- make the homepage responsive
